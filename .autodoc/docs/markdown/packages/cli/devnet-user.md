This code sets various configuration parameters for the Alephium blockchain network. The `alephium.genesis.allocations` array specifies the initial distribution of tokens among a set of addresses. Each object in the array contains an `address` field, which is the recipient of the tokens, an `amount` field, which is the number of tokens allocated to that address, and a `lock-duration` field, which specifies the duration for which the tokens are locked. The `alephium.consensus` object specifies the consensus parameters for the network, such as the number of leading zeros required in a block hash and the target block time. The `alephium.network` object specifies network-related parameters, such as the network ID, the bootstrap nodes, and the network ports. The `alephium.wallet` object specifies wallet-related parameters, such as the locking timeout for the wallet. The `alephium.mempool` object specifies mempool-related parameters, such as whether to automatically mine transactions for development purposes. The `alephium.node` object specifies node-related parameters, such as whether to enable event logging and how to index the event log. The `alephium.mining` object specifies mining-related parameters, such as the mining addresses to use.

Example usage:
```
const alephium = require('alephium-web3');

alephium.genesis.allocations = [
  {
    address: "1DrDyTr9RpRsQnDnXo2YRiPzPW4ooHX5LLoqXrqfMrpQH",
    amount: 1000000000000000000000000,
    "lock-duration": 0 seconds
  },
  {
    address: "14UAjZ3qcmEVKdTo84Kwf4RprTQi86w2TefnnGFjov9xF",
    amount: 1000000000000000000000000,
    "lock-duration": 0 seconds
  }
];

alephium.consensus.num-zeros-at-least-in-hash = 1;

alephium.network.network-id = 5;

alephium.wallet.locking-timeout = 60 minutes;

alephium.mempool.auto-mine-for-dev = false;

alephium.node.event-log.enabled = false;

alephium.mining.miner-addresses = [
  "1FsroWmeJPBhcPiUr37pWXdojRBe6jdey9uukEXk1TheA",
  "1CQvSXsmM5BMFKguKDPpNUfw1idiut8UifLtT8748JdHc"

## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `alephium.genesis.allocations` array?
   - The `alephium.genesis.allocations` array specifies the initial token allocations for the genesis block of the Alephium blockchain.
2. What is the significance of the `alephium.network.leman-hard-fork-timestamp` value?
   - The `alephium.network.leman-hard-fork-timestamp` value specifies the timestamp for the Leman hard fork on the Alephium network, which is scheduled for January 30th, 2022 at 00:00:00 GMT.
3. What is the purpose of the `alephium.mining.miner-addresses` array?
   - The `alephium.mining.miner-addresses` array specifies a list of arbitrary mining addresses that can be used for mining on the Alephium network.
